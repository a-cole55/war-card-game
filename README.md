Description:
Do you remember the childhood card game "War"? Well this is my attempt to recreate this fun-loving game. Be warned this is an ever evolving project as I increase my coding skills so please check it out and provide feedback/suggestions for improvement! This project incorporates API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. You can access this project live at https://declare-war.netlify.app. Or if you would like to take it up a notch, feel free to fork the repository and create your own magic. I hope you enjoy!
